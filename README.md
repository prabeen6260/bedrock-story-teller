## Bedrock Storyteller 🐑

A full-stack serverless application that generates short stories and matching scene illustrations using generative AI.

Live Demo: https://story-teller.lambda-lambs.com

## Technologies
Architecture
The application runs entirely on serverless infrastructure, keeping costs near zero when idle.


Tech Stack

    Frontend: React (Vite), TypeScript, CSS Modules.

    Backend: Python 3.12 (FastAPI), Dockerized.

    AI Models: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku), Google Gemini (via API).

    Infrastructure: Terraform (IaC).

    CI/CD: GitHub Actions (OIDC authentication).

    Cloud Services:

        Compute: AWS Lambda (Container Image).

        Hosting: S3 + CloudFront (Global CDN).

        DNS: Route 53.

        Security: IAM Roles (Least Privilege).

Key Features

    Hybrid AI Pipeline: Orchestrates calls between Bedrock (for high-quality narrative text) and generative models for visuals.

    Serverless Docker: The backend is packaged as a Docker container but runs on Lambda, avoiding the complexity of EC2/ECS.

    Automated Deployment: Commits to main trigger a pipeline that builds the Docker image, updates the Lambda function, builds the React frontend, and syncs it to S3.

    Infrastructure as Code: Entire AWS environment (Networking, Compute, Storage, DNS) is defined in Terraform.
